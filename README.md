Done by Bruce Young

## Introduction 
This is a basic python-based program that can realize some major algorithms in indoor positioning field, such as K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN), Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-layer Perceptron. Based on the collected data (eg. WiFi),  you can construct the offline fingerprint database and online test dataset, and then run this program to  achieve simple indoor positioning.

## Usage
The program consists of main function, data file and function file. Specifically, data is stored in data-file, including offline fingerprint database and online test data.
1. Make sure data is put in the right address.
2. Choose your intended algorithm to localize.
